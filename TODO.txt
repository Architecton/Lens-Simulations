FUNCTIONALITY
* support for any multiply of 2 intersections
* support for optional plotting of configuration and optional ray and normal plotting (all rays or just intersection rays)
* make note that plotting of lens is only supported in MATLAB
* MAIN SCRIPT FOR RUNNING THE SIMULATIONS IN A USER FRIENDLY MANNER

INTERACTIVITY
* Top down view of rays through sphere with changeable distance (image on right)
* Top down view of rays through sphere with changeable sphere scaling in the x direction (image on right)
* Top down view of rays through sphere with 0.3 sphere scaling in the x direction with changable distance from screen (image on right)

IMAGES
* High quality image transformed with spherical lens at certain distance
* High quality image transformed with torus lens at certain distance
* High quality image transformed with "Heart" lens at certain distance
